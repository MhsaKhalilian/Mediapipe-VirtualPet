# Mediapipe-VirtualPet

This project uses Mediapipe to create an interactive virtual pet. The pet will respond to specific gestures:
- If you show your palm, the pet will wave back.
- If you show a Korean heart, the pet will blush.

To get started, clone this repository and follow the setup instructions below.
